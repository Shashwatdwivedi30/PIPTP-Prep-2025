```
Pseudo Code

function xyz()
  print 0
  xyz()

end function
xyz()


Steps:
Step 1: We will check the condition i.e. 1 < 5 so we will enter in while loop for 1st time.
Step 2: Now the value of a will be increased by 2 so it becomes 3,
Step 3: Now we will check again weather a is less than 5 or not, i.e. 3 < 5 so condition is true and the while loop will execute for the 2nd time.
Step 4: Now the value of a becomes 5 and on checking the condition of while loop it returns false.

RESULT: The while loop will execute for 2 times only.
